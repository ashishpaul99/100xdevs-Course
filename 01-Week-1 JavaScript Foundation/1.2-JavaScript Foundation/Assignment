1. ->cluster module -> google it, sub rountines in multithreading languages.

2. Simple primitives
Variables (let, var, const)
Data types - strings, numbers and booleans
If/else
Loops - For loop
2. Let’s write some code -

1. Write the program to greet a person given their first and last name


2. Write a program that greets a person based on their gender. (If else)
3. Write a program that counts from 0 - 1000 and prints (for loop)

3. Complex primitives
1. Arrays
2. Objects

1. Write a program prints all the even numbers in an array
2. Write a program to print the biggest number in an array
3. Write a program that prints all the male people’s first name given a complex object
4. Write a program that reverses all the elements of an array

4. Functions
Let’s write some code -
1. Write a function that finds the sum of two numbers
2. Write another function that displays this result in a pretty format
3. Write another function that takes this sum and prints it in passive tense
