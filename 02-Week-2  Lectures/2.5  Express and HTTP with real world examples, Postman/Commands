1. npm init -y
The command npm init -y initializes a new Node.js project with default settings, skipping the interactive prompts typically involved in setting up a new project. Here's what each part of the command does:

npm: This invokes the Node Package Manager, which is used to manage dependencies and scripts for Node.js projects.
init: This is a command in npm used to initialize a new Node.js project.
-y: This flag tells npm to automatically answer "yes" to all prompts that would normally be presented during the initialization process. It stands for "yes" or "yes to all".
So, when you run npm init -y, npm creates a package.json file with default settings, without asking for your input. This is useful for quickly setting up a new project with minimal configuration.


2. npm install express

The command npm install express is used to install the Express.js framework for building web applications with Node.js. Here's what each part of the command does:

npm: Invokes the Node Package Manager.
install: Command used to install packages.
express: The name of the package you want to install. In this case, it's Express.js.
When you run npm install express, npm will download the Express.js package from the npm registry and install it into your project's node_modules directory. Additionally, it will update your package.json file to include Express.js as a dependency, along with its version number.
