How to push code to github?
->To push a file to a GitHub repository, you'll need to follow these general steps. I'll assume you've already set up a GitHub repository and have Git installed on your local machine:

1. Initialize a Git repository (if not done already):
->If your project is not yet a Git repository, navigate to your project's directory in the terminal and run:
->git init

2. Add a remote repository (if not added already):
->If you haven't added your GitHub repository as a remote, use the following command:

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
Replace the URL with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.

3. Add and commit your file:
->First, stage your file(s) for commit:

git add filename.ext

->Replace filename.ext with the actual name of the file you want to add.

->Then, commit the changes:

git commit -m "Add your commit message here"

4. Push your changes to GitHub:
->If you're pushing to the main branch (or master branch in older repositories), use:

git push -u origin main

Replace main with the name of your branch if it's different.
