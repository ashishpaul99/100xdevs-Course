8.1 Working with git 
1. select a file -> open terminal or click show more option -> git bash here(git bash opens inside folder)
->git is intialized into project.

2. git status is a Git command used to display the current status of your working directory and staging area in a Git repository.
1. Changes to be committed (in the staging area)
This section shows the files that have been modified and staged for the next commit

2. Changes not staged for commit:
Here, Git displays the files that have been modified but are not yet staged. You need to add them to the staging area before committing.

3. Untracked files:
This section lists files in your working directory that are not yet tracked by Git. To include them in version control, you typically use git add to stage them.

=>Workflow of git through example

1. use git init command
-> it intialize git into project.
command: git init
->use ls -al for seeing hidden folders.

2. use git add to add files to git.
->It takes files from local repo to stage area.
->if file is not tracked then use git add command.

3. before commiting type this command and give email and username
1. Set a user name:
->git config --global user.name "Your Name"

2. Set a user email:
->git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"



3. use git Commit with some message
->it save chages and moves files from stage area to repository.
-> "-m" which is used to give comment.
Command: git commit -m "first commit" fileName

->after commiting then it is in main branch.
-> branch name is highlighted in git.
eg: Ashishpaul@DESKTOP-12AGMBF MINGW64 ~/Desktop/git (main)

4. create Github token in order to push code in to repository.

Profile -> developer settings -> Token(classic) -->generate new token --> click on generate new classic -> give any name to token-->choose expiration date --> chek all the options.
->token can be seen once if window closes it cannot be seen again. backup this token.

5. git remote add origin 
->The git remote add origin command is used to add a remote repository named "origin" to your local Git repository. 
->This is commonly done when you want to connect your local repository to a remote repository on a server (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). 
->The "origin" is just a conventionally used name for the default remote repository,

->basic syntax:
git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>

->connecting local repository to github repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git

->add a remote repository with a token
git remote add origin https://username:token@github.com/username/repo.git

eg-1:
->token: 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
 git remote add origin https://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@github.com/ashishpaul99/Learning-Git

 ->this commands add remote origin for this project.

 6. git push
 ->The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. 
 ->It's a fundamental Git command for sharing your changes with others or updating a remote repository.


 -> to push changes from your local "main" branch to the remote repository named "origin," use
 Command: git push origin main

 ->If this is the first time you're pushing the branch, you might need to set up tracking with the -u 

 cmd: git push -u origin main

 ->This establishes a tracking relationship between your local branch and the remote branch, making it more convenient for future pushes and pulls.

 eg-1:It pushes code to github repository
 Ashishpaul@DESKTOP-12AGMBF MINGW64 ~/Desktop/git (main)
$ git push -u origin main
